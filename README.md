In this project, I implemented a cloud infrastructure using VirtualBox, 
leveraging Windows Server 2019, Windows 10, and TrueNAS Core. 
This setup involves deploying Windows Server 2019 to manage network resources and domain services, 
Windows 10 as a client operating system forend-user interactions 
and TrueNAS Core for robust storage solutions. 
This virtualized environment allows for efficient resource management, scalability, and high availability,
providing a comprehensive solution for both development and production needs.
